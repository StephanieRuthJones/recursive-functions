# What is a recursive fn? #

* A fn that calls itself
* decomposed problems that look the same
* anything you can do w a loop, you can do with a recursive funciton

# every recursive function needs... # 

* to have a "base case"
* something that changes every time (need to get closer to the base case every time call the fn)
* an initial state
